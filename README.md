# This Project

This project is built to go along with [todo-backend](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-backend) and [todo-flutter](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-flutter/). It is supposed to give additional information on creating and managing projects, Angular, Flutter, Express, MongoDB, and NodeJS. This project is one of the first projects I have done where I have created a backend and frontend and linked them. So, I think I will learn a lot.

## What I Learned

I learned so much about a MEAN stack and linking together the backend and frontend of a project. I learned about how to setup and design databases, create APIs, and create nice looking frontend applications. This project also gave me more insight into to process of creating projects.

## Running

In order to run this project, you have to download the [todo-backend](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-backend/) project, then install dependencies with `npm install -y`, then run with `npm start`, make sure you have MongoDB installed. Then, move to this project and run `npm install -y`, then `ng serve`. If no problems arise, you should have this project running on http://localhost:4200. You can now try this with electron! To do so, follow the instructions on [this branch](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-angular/tree/todo-desktop). Note: I can't put this on Github Pages as that would require a server to host the backend.
