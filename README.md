# This Project

This project is built to go along with [todo-backend](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-backend) and [todo-flutter](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-flutter/). It is supposed to give additional information on creating and managing projects, Angular, Flutter, Express, MongoDB, and NodeJS. This project is one of the first projects I have done where I have created a backend and frontend and linked them. So, I think I will learn a lot.

## What I Learned

From this branch, I learned how to integrate Electron into existing apps, use electron with angular, electron, and more about package.json.

## Running

In order to run this project, you have to download the [todo-backend](https://github.com/jwjbadger/todo-backend/) project, then install dependencies with `npm install -y`, then run with `npm start`, make sure you have MongoDB installed. Then, move to this project and run `npm run electron-build`, after a bit, this should open a new window. After you have run this command, you can run the program (without packaging) with `npm run electron`. Also, you could use `npm i electron-packager -g`, then `electron-packager .` to get a binary for your OS.
